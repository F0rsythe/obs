### Pentesting Fundamentals
---
1. Ethics: Take an ethical perspective on what we do
2. Permission: get permission from an authorized personnel before you do anything. e,g scan or interact or exploit vulnerabilities.
3. Research:
4. I will benefit the owner: don't think like this, you still have to ask permission
5. Internal team or external consultancy: external need to breed professionalism. 
6. Sympathy for the customer: don't ridicule the customer
7. Respect for peers: respect others
### Firefighters, not fire

2. Learn how fires start and grow
3. Positive influence
4. Bridge between cyber and business
5. Its an issue of trust: People must trust you to be in business. If you abuse the trust, you loose customers
### Why Penetration Testing 
---
Threat Landscape
1. Attack Surface
2. Malware
3. Passwords
4. Vulnerabilities
5. Pivoting
The tension between product and security: working in a fast environment, CICD
Security degrades over time if you don't maintain it
### Scope
Some entities choose which of the systems to pen-test.
1. White box pen-test: knowing the environment before you pen-test
2. Black box pen-test: pen-testing without no knowledge of the system. Simulating an attack.
3. Grey box pen-test: pen-testing with partial knowledge.
4. Internal and External. External is testing the perimeter, while internal testing is the testing fron the inside. 
5. Network, OS, application or db: 
6. Social Engineering:
7. Wireless:
8. Smart Phone Apps
9. Physical Assets
10. OSINT
### Rules of Engagement
1. Testing windows
2. Written Authorization
3. Contact names
4. When to reach for the bat phone: for critical vulnerabilities
5. Scope: IP address ranges, DNS domains, Applications and data
